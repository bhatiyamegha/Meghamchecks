**HTTP1.1**
It works on the textual format.
There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesnâ€™t get its all resources.
It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages
It compresses data by itself.
EXAMPLE - 
when you make a request to the server for the passportseva.html page & server responds to you as a resource geeksforgeeks.html page.
Before sending the request and the response there is a TCP connection established between client & server. 
Again you make a request to the server for image img.jpg & the server gives a response as an image img.jpg. the connection was not 
lost here after the first request because we add a keep-alive header which is the part of the request so there is an open connection between the server & client. 
There is a persistent connection which means several requests & responses are merged in a single connection. 
These are the drawbacks that - 
Lead to the creation of HTTP/2: The first problem is HTTP/1.1 transfer all the requests & responses in the plain text message form.
The second one is head of line blocking in which TCP connection is blocked all other requests until the response does not receive. 
All the information related to the header file is repeated in every request.

**HTTP2**
It works on the binary protocol.
It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.
It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages.
It uses HPACK for data compression.
HTTP/2 was developed over the SPDY protocol. HTTP/2 works on the binary framing layer instead of textual that converts all the messages 
in binary format. 
It works on fully multiplexed that is one TCP connection is used for multiple requests. 
HTTP/2 uses HPACK which is used to split data from header. 
It compresses the header.
 The server sends all the other files like CSS & JS without the request of the client using the PUSH frame.
